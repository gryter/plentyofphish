# Account Recovery

Accounts can be "recovered" after a password change within 30 days of the change. After 30 days have passed, the new password becomes permanent and irreveribly applied to the account.

## Checking Recovery Account

The "recovery account" or "trustee account" is the account that has been set in the Steem blockchain to act as an administrator of your account. Typically, it is the account that was used to create your account. All accounts must be created by other accounts. 

If you signed up through the Steemit.com website, your recovery account is @steem. You can check your recovery account by going to https://steemd.com/@yourusernamehere and searching for "Recovery account" on the left-hand side.

# Accounts Created via Steemit.com

1. Go to https://steemit.com/recover_account_step_1
2. Put in the account name and your most recent recorded password.
3. When prompted for an email address, be sure to use the email you used to sign up with.
4. Monitor your email and wait up to 24 hours for your recovery email.
5. If you don't get your email within 24 hours, go to steem.chat and ask for assistance in the #help room.

# Accounts Created via 3rd Party Services

Each account creation service has its own recovery request form and is solely responsible for recovering the account. Steemit Inc has no way of conducting password recoveries of accounts made through 3rd party services.

# Issues

## Trustee Account Changed

If your trustee account has been changed, the password recovery procedure can still be initiated through your old trustee account. Trustee account changes take 30 days to become permanent. Watch for trustee account changes in Steemd and ask for help immediately after spotting them.

## Active Authority Changed

You may still have control of your account but your active key has been compromised and altered. One tool to revoke the active authority is https://thenoblebot.herokuapp.com.

## Vesting Route Changed

The vesting route controls what account your account powers down into. Hackers often set it to their own accounts while they have control of their victims' accounts. The vesting route may be revoked to default using eSteem and Vessel.
