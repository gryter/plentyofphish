# Account Recovery

Accounts can be "recovered" after a password change within 30 days of the change. After 30 days have passed, the new password becomes permanent and irreveribly applied to the account.

## Checking Recovery Account

The "recovery account" or "trustee account" is the account that has been set in the Steem blockchain to act as an administrator of your account. Typically, it is the account that was used to create your account. All accounts must be created by other accounts. 

You can check your recovery account by going to https://hiveblocks.com/@yourusernamehere and searching for "Recovery account" on the left-hand side.

# Issues

## Trustee Account Changed

If your trustee account has been changed, the password recovery procedure can still be initiated through your old trustee account. Trustee account changes take 30 days to become permanent. Watch for trustee account changes in Steemd and ask for help immediately after spotting them.

## Active Authority Changed

You may still have control of your account but your active key has been compromised and altered. One tool to revoke the active authority is https://thenoblebot.herokuapp.com.

## Vesting Route Changed

The vesting route controls what account your account powers down into. Hackers often set it to their own accounts while they have control of their victims' accounts. The vesting route may be revoked to default using eSteem and Vessel.
